# GModPatchTool

![GModPatchTool](GModPatchToolLogo.png)

Automatically patches [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/)'s internal [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework) to:
- Bring CEF up to date
- Fix GMod missing menu/launch issues on macOS and Linux
- Enable [Proprietary Video/Audio codec](https://www.chromium.org/audio-video), like H.264 (MP4) and AAC, support
- Enable [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com) support (but [no VMP](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModPatchTool/issues/100), so Netflix et al. don't work currently...)
- Enable Software WebGL
- Enable partial GPU acceleration
